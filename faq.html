  <h1>TinniTuneout – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</header>

<section>

  <h2>What is TinniTuneout?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>TinniTuneout</strong> is a calm, personalised sound companion designed from lived experience. 
    It creates gentle audio that avoids your tinnitus frequencies, helping your mind focus on more neutral sounds throughout the day.
  </p>

  <h2>Is TinniTuneout a medical treatment?</h2>
  <p>
    No. TinniTuneout is not a medical device and does not diagnose, treat, or cure any condition. 
    It’s a supportive sound tool designed to help you create calmer listening moments.
  </p>

  <h2>How does TinniTuneout help with tinnitus?</h2>
  <p>
    TinniTuneout generates sound that avoids the frequencies you choose in the app. 
    Reducing contrast between your tinnitus and the surrounding sound environment can make the intrusive tones feel less prominent.
  </p>

  <h2>Do I need to know my tinnitus frequency?</h2>
  <p>
    You don’t need to know it beforehand. The <strong>Frequency</strong> tab lets you explore different tones using the jog wheel 
    until you find a pitch that feels similar to what you hear. Tap <em>Listen</em> to hear each frequency and adjust the volume to a comfortable level.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can select individual frequencies, or — if the exact pitch isn’t clear — enable <strong>Range</strong> to choose a broader band. 
    This can be helpful when your tinnitus sits between pitches or includes multiple close‑together tones.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once saved, TinniTuneout simply avoids those frequencies when generating sound.
  </p>

  <h2>What if I can’t find an exact match?</h2>
  <p>
    That’s completely normal. Many people have tinnitus that shifts or contains multiple tones. 
    Choosing a frequency range is often enough to create a more comfortable listening environment.
  </p>

  <h2>Can TinniTuneout make tinnitus worse?</h2>
  <p>
    TinniTuneout is designed to be gentle and non‑intrusive. You’re always in control of the volume and sound type, 
    and it’s important to keep the volume at a level that feels comfortable for you. 
    If anything feels too loud or distracting, you can adjust or stop the audio at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also use the built‑in <strong>timer</strong> to set a session length that suits you, 
    so the sound stops automatically when you’re done.
  </p>

  <h2>When should I use TinniTuneout?</h2>
  <p>
    There’s no set schedule or recommended timing. Some people use TinniTuneout during quiet moments, while working, 
    or when they want a calmer listening environment — but you can use it whenever it feels comfortable for you.
  </p>

  <h2>Does it work for all types of tinnitus?</h2>
  <p>
    Everyone’s tinnitus is different. TinniTuneout doesn’t promise results, 
    but many people find that frequency‑aware sound makes their tinnitus feel less intrusive.
  </p>

  <h2>Is my data stored or shared?</h2>
  <p>
    No. TinniTuneout is designed with privacy in mind. Your sound settings stay on your device and are never shared externally.
  </p>

  <h2>Does TinniTuneout require an internet connection?</h2>
  <p>
    No. All sound generation happens on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Is TinniTuneout free?</h2>
  <p>
    You can download TinniTuneout and try all features free for 7 days. 
    After the trial, a low‑cost monthly subscription is required if you’d like to continue using the app. 
    You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime in your App Store settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Does it work on iPhone, iPad, and Android?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. TinniTuneout is available on both iOS and Android devices. 
    It also runs on iPad, though the experience is primarily designed for mobile.
  </p>

  <h2>Who created TinniTuneout?</h2>
  <p>
    TinniTuneout was created from lived experience — designed by someone who understands the day‑to‑day reality of tinnitus 
    and wanted a calmer, more personalised sound tool.
