    <p>
      <strong>TinniTuneout</strong> is your personalized sound companion, shaped by real lived experience to help you tune out tinnitus. It offers gentle, customizable audio patterns that help create calmer, more comfortable listening moments throughout your day. Many people who experience persistent internal sounds use supportive background audio to help shift their focus toward something more neutral. Whether you’re easing into the morning, navigating a busy afternoon, or winding down before sleep, TinniTuneout helps you build moments of ease into your routine.
    </p>
    <h2>How TinniTuneout supports you</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Custom sound options:</strong> Choose between two unique sound types designed to create a more comfortable listening backdrop:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Pips</em> — Natural‑sounding tonal pulses shaped to avoid the tones you personally notice. These gentle “pips” resemble soothing natural sounds, like crickets on a warm night.</li>
      <li><em>Narrow‑Band Noise</em> — Carefully crafted noise that leaves space around the internal sounds you hear, helping your attention settle on something more neutral.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Wave‑like patterns:</strong> Sounds ebb and flow like ocean waves, gently rising and fading to keep your attention engaged without overwhelming it.</li>
  <li><strong>Tailor it to your needs:</strong> On the Wave tab, adjust how the sounds move — set wave duration and gaps to customize how each wave flows in and out.</li>
	<li><strong>Timer included:</strong> Set a session length that suits your needs, then relax knowing it will stop automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Runs in the background:</strong> Continue using your phone while your personalized sound environment plays.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Access and subscription</h2>
    <p>
      TinniTuneout requires a subscription to access its features. A free 7‑day trial is available to help you explore the app before committing. At the end of the free trial, you will be presented with the option to purchase a monthly subscription to continue using the app. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your App Store account settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy‑first design</h2>
    <p>
      TinniTuneout values your trust. No accounts or sign‑ups are required. Your tinnitus preferences stay on your device and are never sent to external servers.
    </p>

<h2>Living Well With Tinnitus</h2>
<p>
  Everyone’s experience with internal sound is different, and there’s no single approach that works for everyone. Many people find that gentle background audio helps create a sense of ease and makes the sound feel less dominant. TinniTuneout offers a simple way to build calmer listening moments into your day through personalized soundscapes.
</p>

<h2>Start your journey toward calmer listening</h2>
<p>
  TinniTuneout isn’t a medical device — it’s a supportive sound companion designed to help you relax, focus, and feel more at ease. Over time, many people notice that having a steady, comfortable sound backdrop helps their mind settle and frees up attention for the moments that matter most.
